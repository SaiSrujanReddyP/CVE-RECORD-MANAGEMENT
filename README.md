# CVE Management System
## Overview

The CVE Management System is a robust web application designed to streamline the process of managing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) records. Built with React.js and Material-UI, this system provides an intuitive interface for security professionals to efficiently track, update, and analyze vulnerability data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

**Installation**

1\. Create a new React application:
**
`    	`**npx create-react-app** cve-record-management
**
`    	`**cd** cve-record-management

2\. Replace the content of `**src/App.js**` with the provided `**App.js**` content.

3\. Create a folder named `components` in the `src` directory and add the following files:

`   	 `**a) `Home.js`**

`    	 `**b) `View.js`**


4\. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed:
`  	`**npm install** @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled 	@mui/icons-	material react-router-dom

5\. Run the application:

`    `**npm start**

`    `**The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.**
